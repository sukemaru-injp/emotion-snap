## Code Style & Patterns

- Avoid using the `any` type
- Variable and function names are in camel case.
- Component name is pascal case.
- Formatting will be applied using `pnpm format` after implementation, so it can
  be ignored during development.
- Divide complex logic into functions and name them.
- Directories under `src` can be imported using the `@/` alias.
